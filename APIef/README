Backend is dockerized so it should run after running docker compose, there is some data seeded in database like basic accounts, 
admin account: 
login: admin  
pass: admin 
regular user account: 
login: regular  
pass: regular
Also to be able to easilly test movie functionalities asociated with movie collections i suggest sending request to /api/moviecollections/test/CreateTestCollection 
for this request to work it must be sent with admin permissions.

To run flutter app you can run .apk file or open flutter project in visual studio code, run android emulator 
(to be able to test all functionalities of app you will need at least 2 emulators) and type in command "flutter run"
